## Introduction

The research question(s); Background/significance of the research;
and relevant highlighted information about the data set. (abbreviated version of
part 1)

\begin{itemize}
  \item Does a higher level of educational attainment generally increase personal earnings income across different states?
  \item Does personal earnings increase with an individual's health?
  \item Do older individuals generally earn more money than younger individuals? 
\end{itemize}

Given the rise in inflation and cost of living, exploring the relationships connected to personal earnings across different states is fundamental to understanding how factors like education, health status, and age, influence income disparities at a regional level.This inquiry is grounded in the longstanding debate within economic and social research regarding the return on investment in education, health, and wellness. By examining these relationships across diverse geographical areas, the analysis can uncover nuanced insights into how local economies, policies, and opportunities shape the economic benefits of educational attainment. 

The U.S. Census is pivotal in the nation's political and economic framework, ensuring each community receives its fair share based on its specific needs (Bureau, 2021).

In addition, it is crucial to the political sphere with its use in redrawing a multitude of political boundaries to ensure each district contains roughly equal numbers of people (Mather & Scommegna, 2019). Its political importance extends even to the U.S. House of Representatives, which bases its apportionment of House seats on Census population data, safeguarding the equity of voting power within the nation (Farley, 2020). 


Originating from multiple reputable sources, the dataset focuses on the United States demographic, economic, and educational landscapes as of 2020. It's based on the US Census Bureau's Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) survey, including the Current Population Survey (CPS) for employment statistics, and adds questions on poverty and migration. Unemployment data comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and urban population percentages from the Census Bureau's Decennial Census. State sales tax rates, sourced from the Tax Foundation, provide a financial perspective.

The dataset was merged on a state basis, focusing on individuals 18 and older to better represent the adult population. It includes averages of education level, gender, work expenses, and age from the ASEC survey, combined with unemployment rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and sales tax rates from the Tax Foundation at the state level. 

## Methods and Analysis

Include EDA from Report 1 

ANALYSIS: 
- Multiple linear regression logistic regression 
- Include required analysis steps
• Include the ”added techniques” that you selected
• Assessing the model.
• Selecting a final ”best” model.
• NOTE: Your analysis should follow the appropriate order on your poster with a
logical flow

Model building with significance testing (should be supported by EDA and/or variable
screening)
• Identify and check for multicollinearity
• Residual analysis (assumptions + extreme observations) Make necessary adjustments as
you see fit. If you are attempting to correct a violation, you only need to try up to three
corrections, if the first doesn’t work. Include plots or output as needed.
• Final model selected should be assessed. It may not be great, but you will explain that in
conclusion
• Include at least ONE additional techniques from the list to add to your analysis:
Weighted least squares (Ch 9.4), External Model validation (Ch 5.11), box -cox
transformation (supplemental), or another technique or aspect of MLR you learned on
your own.
• NOTE: if you have a unique situation with your data- discuss your analysis plan with Prof
Varanyak

## Results
The statistical interpretation of the final model. This should be in
statistical terms and overall interpreting and assessing the statistical usefulness
of the model with the appropriate metrics. There should be no R output (that
will go in the appendix). However, you will include your final model.



## Conclusions
- interpreting your results of the analyses in context of the problem
- commenting on areas of future improvements.

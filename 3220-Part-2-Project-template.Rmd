## Introduction

The research question(s); Background/significance of the research;
and relevant highlighted information about the data set. (abbreviated version of
part 1)

Given the rise in inflation and cost of living, exploring the relationships connected to personal earnings across different states is fundamental to understanding how factors like education, health status, and age, influence income disparities at a regional level. This inquiry is grounded in the longstanding debate within economic and social research regarding the return on investment in education, health, and wellness. By examining these relationships across diverse geographical areas, the analysis can uncover nuanced insights into how local economies, policies, and opportunities shape the economic benefits of educational attainment. This approach tackles crucial societal issues related to our economy by revealing the controllable factors correlated with high earners, providing insights into the social class hierarchy that revolves around income and career.

The U.S. Census is pivotal in shaping the nation’s political and economic landscape; its results directly influence the allocation of federal funds toward schools, hospitals, public works, and roads, determined by breakdowns and totals for practically countless variables. The accurate reporting of this data is crucial to ensure each community receives its fair share based on its specific needs (Bureau, 2021). Census data is also crucial to the political sphere with its use in redrawing a multitude of political boundaries to ensure each district contains roughly equal numbers of people (Mather & Scommegna, 2019).  Its political importance extends even to the U.S. House of Representatives, which bases its apportionment of House seats on Census population data, safeguarding the equity of voting power within the nation (Farley, 2020). Ultimately, the Census is vital in the assurance of a fair and functional democracy, extending deep into American life underscoring the importance of its comprehensive methods.
## Methods and Analysis

Include EDA from Report 1 

ANALYSIS: 
- Multiple linear regression logistic regression 
- Include required analysis steps
• Include the ”added techniques” that you selected
• Assessing the model.
• Selecting a final ”best” model.
• NOTE: Your analysis should follow the appropriate order on your poster with a
logical flow
```{r}

```

## Results
The statistical interpretation of the final model. This should be in
statistical terms and overall interpreting and assessing the statistical usefulness
of the model with the appropriate metrics. There should be no R output (that
will go in the appendix). However, you will include your final model.



## Conclusions
- interpreting your results of the analyses in context of the problem
- commenting on areas of future improvements.

| **State by FIPS Code**                 | `STATEFIPS`       | A qualitative measure that identifies the U.S. state (or D.C.) corresponding to the observation by a standardized numeric code. The 51 possible levels are discrete, ranging from 1-56, omitting 3, 7, 14, 43, and 52.                                           |
| **State**                              | `State`           | A qualitative measure that identifies the state corresponding to the observation. The 51 possible levels are names of the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.                                                                                          |
| **Educational Attainment**             | `H_ED`            | A qualitative measure that identifies the average of highest education among adult residents of a given state. The three possible levels include a Vocational Associate's Degree, an Academic Associate's Degree, and a Bachelor's Degree.                        |
| **Majority Sex**                       | `SEX`             | A qualitative measure that identifies the predominant sex among a state's adult residents. Two possible levels, male and female, indicate if the adult population of a state is predominately male or female.                                                   |
| **Health Status**                      | `HEA`             | A qualitative measure that reports the average health status of a state's residents.

The two sets report the same first 20 digits of the ID number, differing in the last two. The state variable may be taken from the household set, and matched to this set, which reports on the individual level. 
# i.e.
# H_IDNUM =  00000479261031911011
# PERIDNUM = 0000047926103191101101

## Using histograms
hist(CensusData$RACE)

hist(CensusData$H_ED)
# sufficient as explanatory
hist(CensusData$SEX)
# sufficient as explanatory; relatively equal reporting
hist(CensusData$TOT_IN)
# questionable significance, seems to be binned in a way that ambiguates data
hist(CensusData$PEARNVAL)
# Good response variable; examine any potential categorization in reporting
hist(CensusData$MARITL)
# Look into codebook to find why this isn't binary
hist(CensusData$HEA)
# Good explanatory 
hist(CensusData$RES_DIV)
# Oddly distributed; bimodal with odd pattern (valley immediately adjacent to mode)

# Group by a variable common to another data set.
# But what variable? 
# Whatever variable we group by, we will be limited by the number of unique responses to that variable; for example, if we group by gender, then we will only have 2 observations to perform regression analysis on. Ideally, we should have at least 30-50. 
# To find out the number of unique responses for each variable: 
number_of_responses <- sapply(CensusData, function(column) {
  if(is.numeric(column)) { 
    return(length(unique(column))) 
  } else {
    return(FALSE)
  }
})
print(number_of_responses)
```


```{r, include = F}
# \sout{Continued GroupBy Exploration} *This chunk is unnecessary; preserved for potentially useful code*
# RACE (25), TOT_IN (42), and maybe H_ED (17) seem like viable variables to group by. 
# Extracting these variables for further analysis: 
potentialGroupBy<-CensusData[c("RACE", "TOT_IN", "H_ED")]
results<-list()
for (i in names(potentialGroupBy)[1:3]) {
  counts<-potentialGroupBy |>
           group_by(.data[[i]]) |>
           summarize(Count=n())
  results[[i]] <- counts
}
results$RACE
results$TOT_IN
results$H_ED

# \sout{TOT_IN appears to be the best variable to group by statistically. It is the most evenly distributed of the three variables; each unique response has approximately the same number count. RACE is highly differential in its reporting. H_ED is intermediate of the two, and could function as a backup. 

# However, if another dataset possesses identical variables, it may be appended directly to the end, simply adding more observations. No redefinition of an observation would be necessary; individuals may still be the unit of an observation.} *This portion is unnecessary; preserved for reference*
